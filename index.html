    <h2>
        What is it?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Industrial Revolution was a time in history like no other. Humanity shifted away from being limited by the amount of food they could produce and went into an age of innovation. No longer did it take most of the workforce of a country to produce food since now a single farmer could produce enough food to feed many more people. As farmers lost the profitability of their farms because of lowered food prices along with their jobs being replaced by machines, they moved to cities, hoping to find new jobs for themselves. These cities were centers of knowledge and the epicenters of the future for those who only saw the surface. People who looked deeper would find that the workers did not see it that way. <a href="https://www.historyhit.com/key-inventions-of-the-industrial-revolution/" target="_blank">Some examples of inventions</a>

    <h2>
        Families and Children
    </h2>
    <p>
        Families during the Industrial revolution were desperate to make ends meet and needed any available workers in the household to go to work. Unfortunately, these workers included children. Children were expected to work the same amount as adults in terms of hours and sometimes intensity of work. Families could not afford to put their kids into education, and instead put them onto the streets to find work. The factory owners had some sense and did not put many kids into hard labor jobs leaving those for when they grew up, but put kids into less labor-intensive but still dangerous jobs, most notably cotton processing. Factory owners paid children pennies, without safety standards or training. Children would lose their limbs and not even make enough to buy food to feed themselves (Document 1). Many children, even if their parents could support the family without them working, had to go to work sooner rather than later. Their parents would work in harsh conditions leading to them losing their lives or being incapable of work, and the children had to take the lead in the household. The industrial revolution stole the childhoods away from thousands of children, forcing them to go to work that any day a simple accident could lead to lifelong pain and misery. Children did not have time to experience what the gains to society were that their parents were working for, but overshadowed by the poverty they were born into, never to escape. Children could not get an education, and the cycle of poverty would keep repeating. Skilled jobs would stay with the families that already had skilled workers in them, and the lower classes would forever find the wood for the upper classes to burn.

    <h2>
        New Workers
    </h2>
    <p>
        The driving force behind humans is greed. People want to accumulate as much wealth as they possibly could, to make sure that they can prosper, making this, the driving force behind the industrial revolution. The economy had turned from an agricultural economy where wealthâ€™s determined by how much food one could produce and went to how many goods and services one could sell. Once farming started to become dominated by farmers who already had much land and could afford to buy the new technologies to increase profits further, others who saw the failing opportunities strayed away to the cities to find profit elsewhere. Those people found profit in factories. Factories could produce what one man could take years to do in mere days. The factory owners were in luck because of the lack of need for skilled workers.
